<!--					<h2>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h2>-->
<!--					<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>-->
<!--					<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>-->
<!--					<ul>-->
<!--						<li>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</li>-->
<!--						<li>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</li>-->

<!--					<p>We honour Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>-->
<!--					<p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.-->

<!--					<p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.</p>-->
<!--					<p>Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function.
