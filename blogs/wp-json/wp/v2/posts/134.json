However, here is how you must <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tech4states.com\/blogs\/how-to-fix-a-poor-website-design\/\">fix your poor website design<\/a> in five easy-to-understand hacks.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pick The Right Theme<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>What makes you think your website\u2019s theme is perfect?<\/p>\n<p>Fix the theme. Once the base is strong, everything else automatically falls in line. Before changing your website design theme, ask yourself these three basic questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the color of my logo?<\/li>\n<li>What vision defines my business?<\/li>\n<li>What is my target audience?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Color of my logo?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The color of your logo should be a big part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/\">website design theme<\/a> selection. One, two, or more colors that define your logo should be carried out aesthetically to make a consistent impression.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Business vision.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>How do you see your business?<\/p>\n<p>In a loud or aesthetic way? Because how you perceive and envision your business and its scope helps a lot in building the layout design of your website. The theme selection is a one-time process, and your website theme should reflect your business vision regarding the layout structure.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Who is your target audience?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Do you know your target audience? Good. Now, narrow it down.<\/p>\n<p>You may narrow your target audience through demographic differences. When left with a fine chunk of people made for your product or services, you will mold your website theme to their preferences. It helps in creating a direct impact on your targeted audience.<\/p>\n<p>Is your theme correct? Does it match the three thriving factors? Change your theme!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Your Website Visually Appealing?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The five destroyers of your website visual image are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No White Space<\/li>\n<li>Bad Typography<\/li>\n<li>Confusing Layout<\/li>\n<li>Poor Quality Of Images<\/li>\n<li>Limited Contrast<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your customer doesn\u2019t find your website appealing in the first 14 seconds, you may lose the chance of having a customer and getting a boosted bounce rate. Your website is eventually, at worst, a designed website if it is unchanged.<\/p>\n<p>You need a revamp if your website faces the above five points.<\/p>\n<p><strong>White spaces<\/strong> \u2013 elevate your web design.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Typography<\/strong> \u2013 readability matters more than the design. You heard it! Good typography used by a successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designgravity.co.uk\/web-design-leeds\/\">web design agency Leeds<\/a> should have yielded positive results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Layout<\/strong> \u2013 the role of your layout is to have multiple sections. Filling everything under one large or two areas creates confusion and turns unappealing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Image quality<\/strong> \u2013 high-resolution images with HD quality level up your visual game. Moreover, your audience is drawn away by poor-quality images that are pixelated.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limited contrast<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 if the text and visuals do not stand out from the background, it is terrible and drives your audience away with irritation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Easy Navigation Is The Key.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Things at their places.<\/p>\n<p>Organized things at their places are what good and easy navigation means. Create a toolbar with links or tags that are easy to navigate. Keep your navigation bar options concise. Too many options drive the customers away. Don\u2019t think of putting every possible opportunity that would create mayhem.<\/p>\n<p>Try to make your navigation or toolbar search engine friendly. Adding buttons in the navigation bar instead of links would not help search engines identify as the text on buttons is not indexed. Try to add more relevant links.<\/p>\n<p>Make it concise, appealing, and organized.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Copywriting<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Writing as a part of web design?<\/p>\n<p>In the seek to learn how to improve website design, can writing play a role? Of course! The <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tech4states.com\/blogs\/future-of-web-development-trends\/\">upcoming trends of web development in 2022<\/a><\/strong> highly focus on copywriting.<\/p>\n<p>The poorly designed popular websites have one thing in common: poor writing, structuring, and placement. The content plays a significant role in making or destroying your website design. Yes, the visual material matters, but so does the text over it.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t just fill up spaces with random text but strategize it. There are three significant website content areas that one needs to work on.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>a.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Type of Content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>What kind of content to put in what place matters the most? Customers prefer informative content that guides them toward a solution, and the range where the reader connects automates your lead generation.<\/p>\n<p>Try to create the website content upon the preferences and psych of your target audience. Ask yourself three questions.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the problem?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a gap?<\/li>\n<li>Am I presenting a solution?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will then be able to write correctly a mixture of informative and promotional website content.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>b.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What Is Bad Content?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The content is filled with grammatical errors and punctuational hazards.<\/p>\n<p>If your website has poor-quality content, it gives a wrong impression. Your website visitors wonder how they would manage my purchase if they can\u2019t write correctly. You need to have the content free of grammatical mistakes, punctuational errors, and proper sentence structures. Even Google only approves of high-quality content to stand among the top searches. To win search engines further, there are <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tech4states.com\/blogs\/website-value-tools-to-evaluate-your-website\/\">5 smart website value tools to evaluate your website in 2022<\/a><\/strong> and avoid poor design scenarios.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>c.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Content Placement<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The headlines, CTAs, Buttons, short content, and long-range.<\/p>\n<p>Where should what be placed? Strategize it. Ensure you give out a problem and then put out a button or CTA of the solution. This is an intelligent way of managing website content and not falling into the list of poor website design examples the world laughs at due to lousy content placement.<\/p>\n<p><em>Stick with short, snackable content and win leads.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Finally,<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is just the start of fixing your poorly designed website.
