The platform is designed to accept multiple types of payments, and it can be integrated with various terminals and point-of-sale (POS) systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0One of the most attractive features of Stax is its subscription-based pricing approach. The platform charges a flat monthly fee, which means you can save an amount for every transaction. There are no long-term contracts, making it ideal for businesses with a pre-determined budget. Additionally, the pricing policy is quite transparent, and you are not liable to make higher payments if you have more significant sales.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Additionally, you can easily integrate the platform with your eCommerce store.

However, you do have the option to unblock the transaction in the unfortunate case that the algorithm makes a mistake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can also leverage PayCafe\u2019s multiple tools to provide adequate management for credit card disputes.
