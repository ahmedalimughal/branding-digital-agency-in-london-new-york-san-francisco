Whether you&#8217;re looking to stay up-to-date on the latest trends, gain insights from industry experts, or simply learn something new, there are plenty of great podcasts out there for marketers to explore.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2>Podcasts For Marketers<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.everyonehatesmarketers.com\/\">Everyone Hates Marketers<\/a> with Louis Greener<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This down-to-earth and practical podcast is dedicated to helping marketers learn how to stand out from the crowd. Grenier focuses on both marketing and psychological principles to share ideas and examples of businesses that have stood out from their competitors. He interviews leading experts in all things marketing and branding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone Hates Marketers is not your grandparent\u2019s podcast, however. Grenier is funny and tells it like it is. The tagline for the podcast is \u201cLearn to stand the f*ck out,\u201d so if that\u2019s your style, this is the best podcast for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/show\/1OCuYchAG8TlGv82YARRhy\">Performance Marketing Insiders<\/a> with Chris Mechanic<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the best podcast for marketers that want quick, no-nonsense, yet helpful marketing advice on a daily basis. This podcast used to be named the 3-Minute Marketing Podcast, but now their content averages at about 7 minutes. Still quick enough to listen to on your morning commute or while drinking your first coffee of the day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The host, Chris Mechanic, focuses on growth and performance marketing. He speaks to some of the best growth leaders in the industry, like marketing professionals from Amazon and Poshmark. Even though the episodes are much shorter than other podcasts, you will walk away with just as much tangible information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https:\/\/marketingschool.io\/\">Marketing School<\/a> with Chris Mechanic<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the best podcast for marketers that want quick, no-nonsense, yet helpful marketing advice on a daily basis. This podcast used to be named the 3-Minute Marketing Podcast, but now their content averages at about 7 minutes. Still quick enough to listen to on your morning commute or while drinking your first coffee of the day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The host, Chris Mechanic, focuses on growth and performance marketing. He speaks to some of the best growth leaders in the industry, like marketing professionals from Amazon and Poshmark.

The content is focused on sharing the most up-to-date strategies and tactics for your business&#8217;s lead generation, conversion, and sales.

Michael Stelzner talks to leaders in marketing in a multitude of industries. These episodes are a little longer, around 45 minutes, but not a second is wasted. When you listen to the podcast, you hear Stelzner\u2019s interest in learning everything he possibly can from his guests, which means you can too!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best parts of this podcast is Stelzner\u2019s focus on organic social media marketing. Paid media is discussed, but a lot of time on the podcast is spent looking at organic strategies, which is excellent for those without a large marketing budget, which is why it\u2019s made our list of the best podcasts for marketers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>6. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingovercoffee.com\/\">Marketing Over Coffee<\/a> with Christopher Penn and John Wall<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing Over Coffee is a weekly podcast that discusses both new marketing strategies and traditional strategies.
