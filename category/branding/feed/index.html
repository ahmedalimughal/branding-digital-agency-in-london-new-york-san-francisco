										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of feeling like your brand is getting lost in the crowd? Do you feel like your target audience isn&#8217;t connecting with your messaging? It might be time to give your branding a colourful makeover!</p>
<p>Colour psychology is a powerful tool that can help you create a branding strategy that truly resonates with your audience. By tapping into the emotions and associations that different colours evoke, you can create a brand identity that is both memorable and impactful. Whether you&#8217;re looking to convey a sense of trust and reliability or you want to inspire creativity and innovation, the right colours can help you achieve your goals.</p>
<p>But how do you go about choosing the right colours for your brand? It all starts with understanding the psychology behind colour. For example, did you know that blue is often associated with trust, security, and professionalism? Or that green is often associated with growth, harmony, and balance? By understanding these associations, you can begin to craft a visual identity that speaks to your audience in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re ready to take your branding to the next level, it&#8217;s time to start exploring the wonderful world of colours. From vibrant reds to calming blues and everything in between, there&#8217;s a whole spectrum of hues just waiting to help you tell your brand&#8217;s story. Let&#8217;s dive in and discover what colours can do for your brand!</p>
<h2><strong>The Power Of Colour Psychology</strong></h2>
<p>Did you know that colours can evoke different emotions and behaviours in people? That&#8217;s what colour psychology is all about! By understanding the psychology behind each colour, you can use it strategically in your branding and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>For example, blue is often associated with trust and reliability. This makes it a popular choice for financial institutions, whilst red is often associated with excitement and passion, making it a popular choice for entertainment and sports brands. In addition to these, there are many other colours that have their own unique associations and meanings. For instance, green is often associated with growth and nature, making it a popular choice for eco-friendly brands, whilst purple is often associated with luxury and sophistication, making it a popular choice for high-end brands. There are many other colours with their own unique associations that can be used to evoke different emotions and convey different brand values. By understanding the psychology behind each colour, you can choose the best colours for your brand and use them strategically to connect with your audience and achieve your marketing goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Let&#8217;s Get Colourful!</strong></h3>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s talk about the fun part: choosing the perfect colours for your brand! You want your colours to make your target audience feel all the right things, so think about what colours will get them jumping for joy (or at least smiling). For example, if you&#8217;re targeting new moms, throw in some yellow &#8211; the colour of pure happiness! If you&#8217;re in healthcare, blue is a solid choice because it associates with trust &#8211; something you definitely want from your doctor.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more! Before you go crazy with colour choices, keep in mind that colour preferences can vary based on culture, personal experience, and context. So, while yellow may be a symbol of joy in the West, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in some Eastern cultures. On top of that, different shades of the same colour can have different emotional associations. A bright red may pump up feelings of passion and excitement, while a muted maroon may come across as more sophisticated and mature.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not all fun and games when it comes to picking colours. You also need to think about practical considerations, like how your colours will look on different backgrounds. And don&#8217;t forget, certain colours can become associated with particular brands or industries, so you&#8217;ll want to think carefully about how you want to differentiate yourself.</p>
<p>With all that said, choosing the right colours can do wonders for your brand. A well-chosen palette can help you communicate your brand&#8217;s values and personality, while also making you memorable and trustworthy in your industry. So go ahead and have fun with it &#8211; just make sure you&#8217;re choosing colours that will make your audience feel the right way!</p>
<p>Examples of Colour Psychology:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blue: trust, reliability, calmness</li>
<li>Red: excitement, passion, urgency</li>
<li>Green: nature, peace, growth</li>
<li>Yellow: happiness, optimism, warmth</li>
<li>Orange: friendliness, creativity, energy</li>
<li>Purple: luxury, creativity, sophistication</li>
<li>Black: power, elegance, sophistication</li>
<li>White: purity, simplicity, cleanliness</li>
<li>Grey: neutrality, professionalism, calmness</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t forget, whilst multiple colours may have the right kind of emotion associated, make sure your palette goes together! Sometimes colour clashing can be great for standing out, but you don’t want to stand out in the wrong way. Stick with colours that work together AND have the right associations.</p>
<h2>Colourful Examples Of Successful Branding</h2>
<p>The use of colour psychology is a powerful tool for brands to create brand recognition and influence consumer behaviour. By selecting the right colours, brands can tap into the subconscious associations that people have with certain hues. Therefore creating a strong brand identity that resonates with their target audience.</p>
<p>Netflix is a prime example of a brand that has successfully leveraged colour psychology. Now, red not only evokes excitement but, paired with black…where else have you seen that combination? Cinemas and theatres of course!. This clever use of colour helps to build a connection between Netflix and its audience and reinforces its position as a leading provider of entertainment including movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>Another example of the effective use of colour psychology is Burberry. This brand&#8217;s signature brown colour palette associates with its old-fashioned heritage and has helped to create a strong brand identity that resonates with consumers around the world. By using colour to convey a sense of tradition and history, Burberry has been able to build a loyal customer base that values the brand&#8217;s heritage and quality.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s competitive marketplace, where consumers are bombarded with advertising messages and brand communications, the use of colour psychology has become an essential tool for building strong and memorable brands. By carefully selecting the right colours, and using them in a strategic and consistent way, brands can create a powerful emotional connection with their audience, and build a lasting relationship based on trust and loyalty.</p>

<h2>Tips For Adding Colour To Your Brand</h2>
<p>Here are our top tips for using colour psychology to stand out and send the right message to your audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know your audience: Different colours can evoke different emotions and meanings depending on the target audience. Research the preferences of your target audience and choose colours accordingly.</li>
<li>Consider the context: Colours can have different meanings in different cultures. Take into account the context of your branding and marketing efforts.</li>
<li>Use a limited colour palette: Too many colours can be overwhelming and dilute the impact of your branding. Choose a limited colour palette that reflects your brand identity and stick to it.</li>
<li>Use colour to highlight important information: Bright colours can draw attention to important information or calls to action in your marketing materials.</li>
<li>Balance warm and cool colours: Warm colours (such as red, orange, and yellow) can create a feeling of excitement and energy. Cool colours (such as blue, green, and purple) can create a sense of calm and trust. Use a balance of warm and cool colours to create a desired emotional response in your audience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time To Get Creative!</h2>
<p>Colour psychology is a fun and exciting way to breathe new life into your brand. Trust us, it&#8217;s worth experimenting with! Colour psychology is a fascinating topic that can have a huge impact on your audience&#8217;s emotions and feelings. It&#8217;s time to connect with your audience on a deeper level by choosing the right colour scheme for your brand. Remember, alongside your colour research, be bold and take risks! Don’t stick to the same colours your competitors are using. Use colour psychology instead to your advantage and stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key to using colour psychology in your branding is to have fun and experiment. Don&#8217;t be afraid to try new things and see what works best for you.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logo is an essential part of your brand’s identity. It’s usually the first thing people see when they visit your website, and it can drive the direction of the rest of your brand’s look and feel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it’s vital that you spend some resources on creating your logo. The amount of money dedicated to logo design will differ based on the business size. So, how much should a logo really cost? </span></p>
<h2>Why Is Logo Design So Important?</h2>
<h3>Reveals Your Company’s Purpose</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your logo acts as a first impression of your brand. It distills the brand down and gives potential customers a look into who your company is and what it does. Great logos have the power to communicate 1) what the company sells and 2) how they sell it without the customer looking anywhere else. </span></p>
<h3><b>Brand Recognition</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great logo design is memorable and helps potential customers build trust with the business. It withstands the test of time and allow customers to rely on its consistency. For example, the golden arches of McDonald’s. If you or a family member love McDonald’s, seeing their yellow arches when driving past might fill you with excitement!</span></p>
<h3><b>Value</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an exceptional logo design paired with an exceptional brand is vital in order to increase your company’s revenue. If you’re looking for high-value or luxury consumers or to grow and expand your consumer base, a high-value logo is the key to unlocking these new customers. </span></p>
<h2>Low-Cost Logo Design Option</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a low-cost logo option or a do-it-yourself option, there are a few resources that will make the design process more manageable. </span></p>
<h3><b>Canva</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how much logo design costs, you’ll be happy to know there are plenty of affordable options. Canva is an excellent place for those who don’t have design skills but have a clear idea of what they want their logo to look like. Thousands of different templates are available, and Canva allows you to customise the designs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, there are some cons to using Canva. First, you can’t upload your own fonts unless you have a Pro account, so you will need to find a brand font within Canva. Second, Canva’s marketplace penetration is high, which means that your logo template has probably been used by a lot of other companies. Depending on the template, it may be hard to stand out from the crowd with a templated logo design from Canva. Also, Canva does not allow users to download files in a vector format; only raster files are allowed. (If you’re unsure what a vector or raster file is, check out our “Quick tips” section at the bottom of the page.)</span></p>
<h3><b>Adobe</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two main Adobe options for logo design. The first, Illustrator, is what most designers will use to create a professional logo design. If you want to learn the program, there are a lot of online tutorials available, but keep in mind that it is a steep learning curve and will take some time. The other option is Adobe Spark. Spark offers templated logos and similar usability to Canva. </span></p>
<h3><b>Vectr</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vectr is free software that lets you design an original logo and export it in both raster and vector formats. The software is somewhat basic compared to programs like Illustrator, but sometimes that can be helpful. Vectr also offers tutorials on their website, and you can find helpful tips on YouTube as well. </span></p>
<h3><b>Creative Market</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative Market has one of the largest selections of logo templates online. They do cost money to download, but the cost for most is under $100. Remember that they have licensing requirements for any logos purchased on Creative Market. There are smaller licenses for businesses that will only make about 500 sales in their lifetime, and then an unlimited sales license for larger businesses. </span></p>
<h3><b>Etsy</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Etsy is a surprisingly great and low-cost place to find unique logo templates. You may even be able to work with the seller to have them customize the design for you for an additional cost. Just make sure to ask for the vector and raster files.  </span></p>
<h2>What Will You Receive With Low-Cost Logo Design Option?</h2>
<p><b>Overall, a low-cost logo design might cost anywhere from $0-$1,000. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">DIY logos and templates can be a good way to generate your first logo, but as your business grows, more resources should be invested to refresh your brand elements. An investment in a premium logo helps add value to a business and generates more consumer trust, which means more revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also good to keep in mind that with a low-cost option, you will be doing most of the preparation, research, ideation, and design work yourself or in-house. So, if you’re paying someone in-house to create the design or spending time doing it yourself, it might be better to save company time and invest a bit more in a professional logo designer. </span></p>
<h3>Mid-Range Cost</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are typically created by experienced freelancers that specialize in brand design. Costs can vary widely depending on the scope of the project and the freelancer&#8217;s experience. </span><b>Logos made by freelancers and small design agencies can cost anywhere from $1,000-$5,000.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working with freelancers or small agencies can be a great option for businesses large and small. However, experiences can vary based on the freelancer, so do your research and meet with the designer before work starts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should receive a beautiful, customized logo when working with design freelancers and smaller agencies. They will spend a lot of time learning about your company and your goals and researching logo and brand strategies that might help you get there. This level of care, strategy, and detail costs a bit more but will greatly increase your brand appeal and recognition and generate more revenue for you in the long run. </span></p>
<h2>How Much Does High-End Logo Design Cost?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end logos will have a luxury price point and can cost anywhere between $5,000 and $500,000, although most land </span><b>between $5,000 and $20,000.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High-end logos usually come with an entire branding package. Large agencies should offer you in-depth market research, color theory research, competition analysis, and other important information-gathering tools before they start working on your brand. Usually, these teams will also employ copywriting and messaging specialists to help align every part of your brand to your new logo. It will be one of a kind and help your brand stand out above the rest. </span></p>
<h3>Quick Tips for Business Owners in the Logo Design Process</h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selecting a font for your logo, </span><b>make sure the font is readable</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have ever tried to read a cursive font and struggled to figure out the brand’s name, then you know how important it is that the font is readable. </span></li>
<li><b>Make sure your design is delivered to you as a vector AND raster file.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Raster files, which include .jpg, .png, and .gif files, are created on a pixel grid and measure dots per inch or DPI. These files don’t allow you to make the logo really large or really small without causing distortion. So, if you wanted to place your logo on a banner or sign, a raster file would look distorted. However, a vector file can scale up or down to any size while remaining clear. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to a full-color version of your logo, </span><b>you may want an all-black, all-white, and possibly a gray version of it.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may want to place your logo on a color photo or a colorful piece of merch; in that case, you will want an all-white or all-black option. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, you may also want to </span><b>ask for other color exports of your logo.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you plan to do some print pieces with your logo, a lot of print shops will ask for a CMYK color. In contrast, RGB or color hex codes work best for digital pieces. Figuring out the CMYK, RGB, and Hex Codes for all your brand colors at the beginning of your branding process will help make this process easier.</span></li>

<p>Overall, a DIY brand identity will cost approximately $50-$100, working with freelancers on a brand can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000, and working with an agency will cost $3,000 to $50,000+ depending on their experience and your requirements. This article will explain everything you need to know about brand identity costs.</p>
<h1>What Is a Brand?</h1>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The word “brand” is tossed around a lot in the workplace, but what is a brand? Is it a business&#8217; logo or their color palette? Is it their name and tagline?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, and so much more. Every single time your company interacts with a customer, a follower, or any external audience, they’re experiencing your brand. Basically, your brand is your audience’s perception of your company. Their perception could be a feeling they get when they experience your services or product, or it could be how easily they recognize your branding because they know your products come in a blue striped box.</p>
<p>A brand is simply how your audiences view your company. And your logo, color palette, brand voice, mission statement, emails, website, and anything else your audience might experience help them see your company the way you want them to.</p>
<p>In the world of branding, every aspect matters.</p>
<p>If you offer customer service, how your customer service representatives engage with customers will either reinforce or weaken your brand. If you have a website or social media channels, these also represent your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why Do I Need a Brand?</h2>
<p>Great branding helps you better connect with your ideal customers and clients. A great brand will help potential clients say, “This is where I belong. They understand me.” And a great brand will funnel those potential customers from the interest phase to the conversion phase, where they’re purchasing your product or services, to the brand loyalty phase, where they become repeat buyers and shout their love of your company from the rooftops.</p>
<p>Without brand identity, your customers won’t know whether you’re the right company for them. Think of a brand that you love. For example, a company folks will continue to buy from over and over again is Apple. Apple has a very clear brand identity; they’re usable, sophisticated, and customer-centric. People who love Apple products really love Apple products.</p>
<p>Apple’s brand has attracted the attention of its target clientele. Then, through consistent branding, Apple has been able to convert these potential customers into purchasers over and over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Goes Into Building a Brand Identity?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different elements that make up a brand, which will affect the overall cost of your brand identity. Your company’s brand identity should encompass everything from the overall aesthetic to the way your company uses language and speaks to customers on different platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Brand Name</h3>
<p>A brand name is extremely important but doesn’t have to be the first thing you create. Your brand’s style and unique value proposition may be helpful to think about before coming up with a brand name.</p>
<p>For example, you don’t want a brand name of “EasyFinance” if you’re a financial educator and your target clientele is wealthy c-suite individuals. But if you’re a financial educator for recent graduates, that name might work! Brand naming services typically cost from $1,500 to $20,000 with a naming agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Visual Identity</h3>
<p>Your brand’s visual identity is extremely important. It includes your color scheme, fonts, logo, imagery, shapes &amp; patterns, icons, and any other visual assets. Your brand’s visual identity should be collated into a brand guidelines document, which defines how different brand elements should be used. Brand visual identity design will typically cost $4,000 to $50,000+ with an agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Voice</h3>
<p>How your brand communicates to your target audience on all its different channels is one of the key ways to share your brand’s personality. Are you funny and rugged? Clear and minimalistic? Conversational, yet professional? All of these can impact the cost of your brand identity. Getting<br />
an agency to define your brand voice can cost from $2,000 to $6,000+.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Core Brand Messaging</h3>
<p>Core brand messaging can include things like a tagline, a mission and vision statement, a values statement, a unique value proposition, a brand point of view, and a multitude of other things. These brand elements unite your brand’s messaging and clearly share your unique voice and purpose with your customers.</p>
<p>For example, Nike’s tagline “Just do it” invokes a clear and visceral feeling in those that hear it. It also aligns with its mission statement, “Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world.”</p>
<p>Not all of these brand elements will be visible to your customers, but they will help you and your team stay on track when creating new content. Nike doesn’t share their brand point of view on its website, but it infiltrates every piece of content they produce. To hire an agency to define your brand messaging will cost from $2,000 to $15,000+.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Much Does a Brand Identity Cost?</h2>
<p>There are a few different ways to begin designing your brand identity. You could develop your own brand, outsource your brand design to freelancers, or hire an agency to help you create your brand.</p>
<h3>DIY Brand Identity Costs</h3>
<p>This will be the cheapest option by far, but it will take you the most time of any other options and likely won’t look/be great.</p>
<p>To create your DIY brand, you will need to purchase some software. If you understand design, the Adobe Creative Suite may be a good option, but if not, Canva Pro might serve you better. Adobe is approximately $55 per month for all creative cloud apps. If you just want one app, like Illustrator, the cost is approximately $25 per month. Canva Pro is about $14 per month. These tools will be helpful when creating your logo, color palette, and any other parts of your visual identity.</p>
<p>When creating your own brand, you will have to spend a lot of time building every brand element from scratch.</p>
<p>Time must be spent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Doing market research to find your target audience and identify your competition</li>
<li>Creating a brand personality</li>
<li>Choosing a business name and writing your core brand elements</li>
<li>Designing your logo and selecting your fonts and brand colors</li>
<li>Cultivating your voice and testing messaging</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, a DIY brand identity will cost <strong>approximately $50-$100</strong>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>How Much Does a Brand Identity Cost When Using Freelancers?</h2>
<p>You can hire people or multiple people with specific skill sets when utilizing freelancers. Costs will vary widely due to many different variables, including the level of experience of the freelancer and the needs of your company. Be aware that freelancers’ quality of work will vary hugely, and you’ll likely have to closely manage what they’re doing.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a great copywriter on your staff, they may be able to handle the written aspects of your brand. So, you would be looking for someone to handle the strategy and design elements of your brand identity. Outsourcing pieces of the brand identity while keeping some in-house will help save costs. Then, depending on your budget, you can find an up-and-coming freelancer or an established expert.</p>
<p>Collaborating with freelancers on a brand will cost anywhere from <strong>$1,500 to $5,000</strong>, depending on their experience and your requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Much Does a Brand Identity Cost When Hiring an Agency?</h2>
<p>Working with an agency will always be the best solution. <a href="https://burstdgtl.com/branding-agency/">Branding agencies</a> have experts that work on every element of your brand identity. These experts will work together to ensure your brand is cohesive and strategic. A brand identity created by an agency will, in the long run, generate more interest and sales for your company than any of the other options.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They interview industry leaders like Stripe’s Chief Revenue Officer and have discussions about allyship and businesses’ role in advocating for their community. Inside Intercom is the best podcast for marketers looking for a wide variety of topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a lot of variation in branding costs for an agency, so make sure to do your research before taking the plunge. It would be wise to have <strong>at least $7,500</strong> to spend on creating your brand with an agency.</span></p>
<p>Creating a brand identity is possible regardless of where you’re at with your business or your budget. And remember, a brand is supposed to update and change slightly as your business grows. So, if you don’t have the budget to hire an agency right now, that doesn’t mean you won’t in the future.</p>
