<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a website for a startup is a critical step in establishing your online presence and reaching your target audience.&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>With numerous website builders available, choosing the right one can be overwhelming. Each platform offers unique advantages and drawbacks, catering to different needs and budgets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some startups may not have the capital to invest in a web designer and developer, making website builders like Wix and Squarespace ideal for getting a website up and running. For those with more capital, hiring in-house developers or agencies to create a custom website may be the best option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article will explore the best website builders for startups and small businesses, helping you make an informed decision based on your circumstances.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Budget-Friendly Options</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wix</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> is an excellent choice for startups with limited budgets. It is user-friendly, making it ideal for beginners with no coding experience. Wix offers a variety of pricing plans, starting from free to premium packages, which include more advanced features. Hosting is included in all plans, making it a convenient all-in-one solution.</p>



<p>Wix offers a wide selection of templates that enable you to build visually appealing websites without the need for custom design. These templates are highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to align your site with your brand’s identity. Using intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, you can effortlessly add elements and design your website, even without technical skills.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1920px;" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeD87Qpc4JeY83DSLQKd1Vl84EhDYWSk3aMPG8ok99Yurhg-ihPvcrMOL0UH6_jtu-xptgZeV_15hD9V2JqMTw5ToFJGmmNH8ieD3EO7Df6NxOgzza2aKhUKUPIPzn7FDbwuKQYFWYcIQvxvHnIen78gcwo?key=r2R_2ERNyNaVai-MTY7hCg"></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Squarespace</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> is another popular website builder for startups. It is known for its sleek, professional templates that are perfect for creating a polished online presence. Squarespace offers various pricing plans, which include hosting and a free custom domain for the first year.</p>



<p>Designing a website with Squarespace is straightforward, thanks to its intuitive interface. You can choose from a wide range of templates and customize them to fit your brand. Squarespace also offers robust e-commerce features, making it a great option for businesses looking to sell products online.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1920px;" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcK1fpIJahjiruO1rGZvN-qBtruxfv4fctewxqXTgEBCaz6UpPRisafu7hNCB_7jaXXqBfqni_bN_cvD5DmZAIllPLxu5C5iuZa-vlvqjtira4rXMwh1Yvza8pPk8bd0Ot0UURCo2pUkJhnCyEvGPW3fGxI?key=r2R_2ERNyNaVai-MTY7hCg"></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shopify</strong></h3>



<p>For startups focused on e-commerce, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/id/website/builder">Shopify</a> is a top choice. It provides a powerful website builder specifically designed for online stores. Shopify’s pricing plans are flexible, starting at $19 per month, catering to different business sizes and needs. Hosting is included, and you can choose from numerous themes to create a professional-looking store.</p>



<p>Shopify’s platform is user-friendly, even for those without technical expertise. It offers various tools and features to manage your online store, from inventory management to payment processing. Shopify also supports extensive integrations with other platforms, enhancing your store’s functionality.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WordPress (With Elementor)</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> is a highly flexible and powerful platform that is widely used by businesses of all sizes. While it may have a steeper learning curve compared to Wix or Squarespace, it offers unmatched customization options. With the <a href="https://elementor.com/pricing-plugin/">Elementor plugin</a>, you can use drag-and-drop functionality to build your website, making the process more accessible for beginners.</p>



<p>WordPress offers thousands of templates and themes, both free and paid. It also provides a vast array of plugins to extend your website’s functionality. Although WordPress requires separate hosting, many hosting providers offer affordable plans optimised for WordPress.</p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><img decoding="async" style="width: 1920px;" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfjoawnSoaaNm-a1A1V63cd0qEF7HxhvnP5FJIQGPDbFUbukvFMDmw5nypBOUZDunIi2aVLb12bSZMU5CslIsVUMOePwOgra461wbi3HQhJKVz3CB5XR9mleKbtUY6B74um5PYWlQDu7ou21-wBco0pn-iy?key=r2R_2ERNyNaVai-MTY7hCg"></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Premium Options for Startups with More Capital</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Custom Development</strong></h3>



<p>For startups with significant capital, custom development is the most expensive yet most tailored option. Custom-built websites offer complete control over the design, functionality, and user experience. This allows for unique features and integrations that are not possible with standard website builders.</p>



<p>Custom development typically involves hiring a web design agency or in-house developers. The cost can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the website and the expertise of the developers. However, the investment can result in a highly optimized and scalable website that perfectly fits your business needs.</p>



<p>Advantages of Custom Development:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Complete Control: Full control over the design, functionality, and user experience.</li>



<li>Unique Features: Ability to implement unique features and integrations tailored to your specific business needs.</li>



<li>Scalability: A scalable solution that can grow with your business.</li>



<li>Optimized Performance: Enhanced performance through optimized coding and custom solutions.</li>



<li>Security: Improved security measures tailored to your specific requirements.</li>

<li>Advanced Integrations: Capability to integrate advanced tools and third-party services seamlessly.</li>
</ul>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>By investing in custom development, you can ensure that your website stands out in the competitive digital landscape, providing a unique and engaging experience for your users.</p>



<p></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Webflow</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a> is gaining popularity among web design agencies and is becoming a preferred choice for startups. It offers an all-in-one solution with powerful design tools, hosting, and a CMS. Webflow’s visual editor allows for the creation of complex, responsive websites without writing code. This ease of use makes it attractive for startups looking to build professional websites quickly.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://webflow.com/pricing">Webflow’s pricing plans</a> are competitive, the overall cost of creating a Webflow website might be higher than just the base subscription. This is because you may need to hire an agency or freelancer with specific expertise in Webflow design and development. These professionals can help you leverage Webflow’s advanced capabilities to create a highly customized and effective website.</p>



<p>Advantages of Webflow:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9ikz6KUMmAS8p92E36JkpEEcqd3iTcXvNAAgUOJjtteoC-3_-QQj9EMweOpOqmfZHRbPux9mP6F_9sijE2ReR2mTlJowFOVppClOtmRtG00OXT7GpscNhN--rywOL2TsCjvu0GhPRFqb-oz_et9gefIqY?key=r2R_2ERNyNaVai-MTY7hCg" style="width: 1920px;"></p>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

<p>Hop on board the website creation express, where the ticket prices range from a modest $1,000 all the way up to a jaw-dropping $50,000 and beyond! When you throw in the extras, like snagging a catchy domain name and securing a spot on a custom server, the cost to make a website can soar even higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Picture this: Alex Hormozi famously shelled out a whopping $400,000 just for the domain “acquisition.com”.</p>



<p>Now, while the price tag on some of these digital masterpieces can reach sky-high levels, there’s absolutely no need to break the bank with a nearly half-a-million-dollar spend just to make a business website.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, factoring in web design cost, a sleek, professionally crafted WordPress website expertly designed and penned by a wizard copywriter, kicks off at $5,000. But, keep in mind, this figure can vary based on a handful of key elements:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Size: Just like a sprawling mansion compared to a cosy cottage, the bigger your website, the higher the price.</li>



<li>Functionality: Each tool or feature you add, from online stores to membership portals, adds complexity and cost. </li>



<li>Platform: The foundation of your website, whether it&#8217;s built on WordPress, Shopify, or a custom-built solution, can make a difference.</li>



<li>UI Design: A custom, eye-catching design tailored to your brand can elevate your site but will add to your budget.</li>



<li>Maintenance &amp; Hosting: Like a ship needs a harbour, your website needs a place to reside (hosting) and regular upkeep (maintenance).</li>



<li>SEO: Steering your website to the top of search engine rankings is an art and science. Investing in SEO ensures your site is found by the right people at the right time, but it requires expertise and, yes, additional investment.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Invest in a High-Quality Website?</h2>



<p>The scope of needs for small to medium-sized businesses often settles around 5 to 10 pages, positioning the price tag within the $5,000 to $15,000 spectrum. On the flip side, sprawling international conglomerates might find themselves in need of more than 200 pages, catapulting the cost to make a website considerably higher.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Functionality</strong></h3>



<p>Functionality plays a crucial role. Are you incorporating a login feature? Perhaps you&#8217;re setting up an e-commerce platform. Or is your site essentially a portfolio, aimed at showcasing your business and enticing prospective clients?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complexity of functionality directly influences the need for bespoke coding, thereby elevating the cost.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Platform</strong></h3>



<p>The choice of platform is paramount. Certain agencies specialize in constructing websites using comprehensive solutions like Webflow, Wix Studio, or Framer. Meanwhile, some developers prefer crafting their sites entirely from the ground up. Because of the expertise needed for both, they will drastically increase the cost to make your website.</p>



<p>Our WordPress websites find a happy medium. We employ premium themes alongside tailored coding, ensuring your site is both swiftly developed and optimized for peak performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, this approach ensures that the cost to make your website remains manageable and does not skyrocket.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>UI Design</strong></h3>



<p>Mastering UI design, a significant part of overall web design cost, is a complex challenge. It requires a designer to seamlessly integrate your brand&#8217;s essence with the website&#8217;s objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Too much emphasis on traditional design might render your site obsolete and lackluster, whereas excessively innovative design, brimming with elaborate animations and graphics, could diminish conversion rates and slow down loading times &#8211; not to mention the cost implications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our mission is to strike the ideal harmony, ensuring your website not only looks stunning but also operates exactly as intended!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hosting/ Management</strong></h3>



<p>The cost to make a website, including web design cost, relies significantly on the choice of hosting—whether self-hosted or on major platforms like GoDaddy. Opting for managed hosting might be pricier, but it offers substantial advantages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You benefit from a dedicated team monitoring your site, conducting monthly backups, and optimizing site performance. Additionally, an account manager will be at your disposal for any updates or changes you wish to implement.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEO</strong></h3>



<p>Many websites fall short in being search engine optimized, a crucial misstep when it comes to standing out online and amongst your competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For your site to truly resonate and generate leads, it must surface in search results when users look up anything connected to your business. This process, known as organic traffic, stands as a fundamental pillar in the realm of lead generation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Custom Features &amp; Integrations</strong></h3>



<p>Expanding your website&#8217;s functionality with custom features or special integrations, which are factored into website design prices, can significantly enhance user experience and engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s integrating with CRM systems, incorporating advanced analytics, or adding interactive elements, these customizations require specialized development efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complexity and uniqueness of these features can directly impact the cost to make a website, as they may require more time and expertise to implement effectively. However, they offer a way to distinguish your site, providing a tailored experience to your audience and potentially driving more business value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Training &amp; Support</strong></h3>



<p>Once your website is up and running, understanding how to manage it, a consideration that reflects in the overall website design prices, is crucial. Many agencies offer training sessions and ongoing support to help you and your team navigate the backend of your website efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This can include content management training, how to apply updates, and troubleshooting common issues. While this might increase the initial cost, having the knowledge and resources to maintain your website can save you money and headaches in the long run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Post-Launch Marketing &amp; Promotion</h2>



<p>Building a fantastic website is just the beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To truly capitalize on your investment, consider the costs associated with post-launch marketing and promotion. This can range from search engine marketing (SEM) campaigns, social media advertising, email marketing efforts, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These strategies help drive traffic to your new site, increase brand awareness, and ultimately, contribute to your business goals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While not directly tied to the development costs, allocating budget for marketing and promotion is essential for maximizing the return on your website investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Should I Use A Web Design Agency?</h2>



<p>You might wonder, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t freelancers more budget-friendly? I came across a Fiverr gig offering to craft a professional website for just a few hundred dollars!&#8221; True, they are more economical, but there are caveats to consider.</p>



<p>Securing a comprehensive web design package at such a bargain—a package that includes top-notch UX design, UI design, copywriting, conversion optimization, SEO, and advanced development—is impossible.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No Future Complications</strong></h3>



<p>Opting for a lower-cost solution now could lead to greater expenses later on. Websites on the cheaper end often suffer from issues like inefficient coding, terrible back-end setup, poor optimization, disappointing conversion rates, and sluggish loading times.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smooth Project Management</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t overlook the importance of project management. When working with a freelancer, you&#8217;re often required to have a deep understanding of the site&#8217;s inner workings and will need to micromanage every project detail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many encounter issues only a few months or even years later, discovering insurmountable challenges due to poorly written code, data breaches from inadequate security measures, and slow loading times that deter visitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These problems not only hamper the user experience but can also significantly impact your site&#8217;s search engine ranking and, ultimately, your business&#8217;s bottom line. Furthermore, rectifying these issues often requires additional investments, either to overhaul the website entirely or to patch up deficiencies, which can cumulatively exceed the cost of hiring a professional agency from the start.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opting for a reputable web design agency upfront can save you from these pitfalls by ensuring that your website is built on a solid foundation, with security, performance, scalability, and transparent web design cost in mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Systematic &amp; Structured Approach</strong></h3>



<p>Web design agencies, like Burst Digital, function like finely tuned engines. We&#8217;re engineered to develop superior websites at a fair price. Our full web design teams consist of copywriters, UI designers, graphic designers, and marketing specialists, all working together to ensure your web design journey is seamless from the get-go.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Team Advantage</strong></h3>



<p>Given our diverse and expansive team of skilled experts, our projects extend beyond mere website creation.</p>



<p>To align your digital footprint with your brand&#8217;s voice, our web design crew joins forces with our in-house branding aficionados, wordsmiths, and researchers.</p>



<p>Merging UI and graphic design requires years to master each craft. Fortunately, we’re well-versed in both, enabling us to create visually captivating sites with bespoke graphics.</p>



<p>We recognize the critical need for purpose-driven design. By marrying web design expertise with marketing knowledge, customer journey analysis, and deep research, we ensure your site isn&#8217;t just aesthetically pleasing but also strategically poised to enhance your marketing efforts and customer conversions.</p>



<p>This level of integrated expertise and collaborative effort is nearly impossible for freelancers to replicate, as they typically work alone, limiting the breadth and depth of advantages they can provide.</p>



<p>To sum it up, while the cost of making a website can vary widely based on factors like size, functionality, platform, design, hosting, SEO, and custom features, investing in a high-quality website through a reputable web design agency ensures a solid foundation, mitigates future complications, and maximizes the return on your investment in the long run.</p>

<p>SEO or search engine optimization is fairly complex and can involve a multitude of strategies. WordPress understands these needs and offers businesses a variety of plugins that help them find success. SEO is a strategy with a lot of depth. One can spend hours per day trying to optimize their website, or they could only work on it once a week. Either way, they will see results that match the time spent. This is why plugins are such a great investment! They help website managers handle SEO tasks more efficiently so they can see quicker results, with less time spent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-what-is-seo">What Is SEO?</h3>
<p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. In the simplest terms, <a href="https://burstdgtl.com/search-engine-optimization/">SEO</a> helps you increase your website’s visibility on search engines like Google. Every time someone searches for information online, hundreds and thousands of websites fight to be the first link shown. Creating an effective SEO-optimized website can help your content appear on the first page of Google results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Is a WordPress Plugin?</h3>
<p>Plugins help increase functionality and help personalize the usability of a WordPress website. Sometimes plugins are called modules or extensions, but no matter what they are called, plugins add features to your site. They help optimize workflows and help keep your site running. The best part is a developer is not needed when downloading plugins. Virtually anyone can do it.<br />Plugins can be installed from the administration panel of your site. Find the plugins section and select add new. Then install the plugin!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Do You Need WordPress Plugins on Your Website?</h3>
<p>In reality, you don’t NEED WordPress plugins, but they do make things a lot easier. Especially if you are not an SEO expert, plugins can be a great addition to your digital marketing plan.<br />It is best to think of SEO plugins as a guide. They help direct you to issues on your site and offer recommendations to improve your search ranking. If you don’t need a guide to help you build an optimized site, plugins might not be for you. However, both beginners and experts alike use plugins to create efficiencies and accountability structures around the websites they manage.</p>
<p>Finding the perfect plugin can be stressful, mainly because so many are available. So here is a list of the 10 best WordPress plugins to improve your SEO!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>10 Best WordPress Plugins for SEO</h2>
<h3>Yoast SEO</h3>
<p>Yoast is one of the most popular plugins for WordPress, and there’s a reason why. It does a lot more than SEO, but it does SEO extremely well, and is easily one of the best WordPress plugins for SEO! It is also straightforward to use. A quick search on YouTube will bring up hundreds of video tutorials of folks walking you through every step of the Yoast process.</p>
<p>Yoast focuses on helping you optimize:<br />1. Your URL<br />2. Meta description<br />3. Tags<br />4. Keyword density<br />5.Internal &amp; external links<br />6.Content readability<br />7.Focus keywords</p>
<p>Yoast is user-friendly and will provide digestible recommendations on how to improve your site. They use a stoplight grading system to highlight areas you need to work on. Red means there is something important to address. Yellow means something needs to be addressed when you have time. Green means everything is good!<br />Yoast SEO offers premium versions which can help you optimize your keywords usage, internal link suggestions, and how your webpage is previewed on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>SEOpress</h3>
<p>SEOPress is another all-in-one feature that helps you optimize your site. It is also beginner-friendly but offers advanced options to those who seek them. With SEOPress, you can add image and content XML sitemaps, redirects, meta titles, descriptions, and more.</p>
<p>The free version of SEOPress offers an advert-free experience. So, although there is a paid version, which is significantly cheaper than competitors, most businesses won’t require it. The free version is very holistic and offers a robust infrastructure.</p>
<p>The premium version offers 404 monitoring, IP anonymization, backlink integrations, Google Page Speed integrations, video sitemaps, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SEO Squirrly</h3>
<p>This is a plugin has been expertly designed to support non-SEO experts. It offers valuable SEO strategies without the complicated elements. This means it works differently from other plugins that provide expert-level features. For example, when you’re writing copy for a webpage, SEO SQUIRRLY optimizes and offers recommendations as you write. So, by the time you’re done writing, the webpage is optimized.</p>
<p>SEO SQUIRRLY helps you create content that serves both your human readers and search engines. So, it not only helps people find your website, but it makes them want to stay on it.</p>
<p><br /><strong>SEO SQUIRRLY helps you:<br /></strong>1. Find and use optimal keywords<br />2. Analyze and optimize your articles<br />3. Examine your competition to see how you rank in comparison<br />4. Create an XML sitemap for Google and Bing</p>
<p><br />Squirrly also provides content reports and weekly progress checks, which can be easily shared with others in your organization. They also include a tool that shows recent tweets about your industry and topics that can be used to inspire new and relevant content ideas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SEO Optimized Images</h3>
<p>It might feel like an image optimizer isn’t necessary, but image optimization is a critical part of the SEO process. We use images in our content to help us tell a story. So, in order for search engines to fully understand our content, it is best if they can also “see” the photo.</p>
<p>Alternate text and image titles can help search engines understand what is in your photo. This allows search engines to direct the right traffic to your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Redirection</h3>
<p>You might not expect to see a redirection tool on a “best WordPress plugins for SEO” list, but it’s an important part of your SEO stack! Especially for large websites, 301 redirects and 404 errors can occur frequently. These errors may be harmful to SEO and your customer’s experience on your website.</p>
<p>Redirection helps you monitor 301s and 404s, which is necessary when building your SEO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does Redirection do?</strong> </p>
<p>If you’re updating content on your website at all, sometimes search engine links can take users to URLs that no longer exist. Users get lost and become frustrated with your website and leave. However, with Redirection, search engines are told to stop paying attention to the missing link. This way, the link stops showing up on search engines, and customers can find relevant up-to-date information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Broken Link Checker</h3>
<p>Similarly to redirection, Broken Link Checker scans your website for missing or broken links. Missing links can negatively affect SEO efforts by making it increasingly difficult for search engine crawlers to index your site. </p>
<p>Broken Link Checker keeps an eye on your site and lets you know if we find a broken link. This way, you can take action without requiring you to complete a manual audit. <br />It’s best to turn on Broken Link Checker once per week or at the regular cadence of your choosing. Once the plugin is on, it will scan for broken links. Once those are fixed, turn the plugin off and wait until next week to check again. This way, the plugin’s user interface doesn’t slow down your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WP Video SEO</h3>
<p>If video content is a large portion of your website, WP Video SEO should be on your list of plugins.</p>
<p><strong>WP Video SEO helps you:<br /></strong>1. Optimize SEO for YouTube videos<br />2. Generate a sitemap for YouTube videos<br />3. Index video content</p>
<p>When it comes to video, WP Video SEO is one of the best WordPress plugins!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>WPTouch Mobile Plugin</h3>
<p>Making sure your website is mobile-friendly should always be a top priority. WPTouch Mobile Plugin helps you do this.<br />Google takes into account your website’s mobile-friendliness when ranking your website. This plugin helps you create a responsive, mobile-optimized website for your customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The SEO Framework</h3>
<p>The SEO Framework is another all-inclusive <a href="https://burstdgtl.com/search-engine-optimization/">SEO</a> plugin that serves beginners and experts alike. The plugin can help you automatically create SEO-friendly titles for your posts, keep site speeds high, avoid duplicate URLs, build internal links into your content, and protect your site with anti-spam software.</p>
<p>SEO Framework gives you precisely what you need without any extras. It has a very clear user experience and helps you improve the things that matter the most. A website is optimize through a colored scale, similar to Yoast SEO. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Autoptimize</h3>
<p>Your website speed is one of the key factors in search engine rankings. Not only does Google take this metric into account on its own, but loading speeds also affect your bounce rate and other key metrics that affect your user experience rating. </p>
<p>Autoptimize can ensure your page loads as quickly as possible. The plugin “can aggregate, minify, and cache scripts and styles, inject CSS in the page head by default and can move and defer scripts to the footer. It also minifies the HTML code itself, making your page really lightweight.</p>
<p>Using Autoptimize makes implementing these technical elements much easier.</p>
<p><strong>So, not you know the best WordPress plugins for SEO! If you don’t want to do all of the legwork yourself and are looking for an <a href="https://burstdgtl.com/search-engine-optimization/">SEO Agency</a>, <a href="https://burstdgtl.com/contact-us/">get in touch today</a>!</strong></p>
