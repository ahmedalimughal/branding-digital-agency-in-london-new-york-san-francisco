										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In order to succeed, startups need to be efficient and productive. Without productivity tools that create efficiencies, teams can become overworked, tired, and frustrated. It is important to manage resources effectively, especially when they are finite.</p>
<p>There are thousands of productivity tools on the market, making it challenging to decide what would be best for your team. Thatâs why we have created this list of the top 10 best software productivity tools, to boost your startupâs productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The 10 Best Productivity Tools</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Canva</h3>
<p>Canva can help non-graphic designers fool everyone around them with the beautiful designs they create. Anyone can use Canva to make social media posts, posters, promotional videos, brochures, business cards, or anything else your business might need.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of premade templates to choose from when creating a design. Type your design aesthetic into the search bar and wait for your perfect template to show up. For example, if you prefer a minimalist design, type minimalist and select your favourite template option.</p>
<p>Premium levels of Canva also allow you to upload all of your brand materials. Then, any time you create anything, you can brand it with the click of a button. Canva helps your brand maintain consistency throughout all its visual elements. Another perk of Canva Pro is the ability to collaborate with team members in real-time on a design. The Pro version also allows you to resize your designs. So, if you want to take video content and resize it to use on your Instagram story, you can easily update the dimensions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-pandadoc">PandaDoc</h3>
<p>PandaDoc helps you and your team easily share documents with customers. It helps you create personalized documents like proposals, quotes, contracts, and more, and send them to customers to sign and approve. Documents can be easily created in minutes. You can set certain styles, including custom colours, themes, and fonts, so your documents have your branding.</p>
<p>The software also tracks the documents so you and your team can stay up to date with the customer journey and provide the best customer service experience. The software dashboard shows you which documents have been signed and which havenât, so you can easily track each proposal or contract you send out.<br />
They offer a 14-day free trial and 3 different premium plans: Essentials, Business, and Enterprise. They also offer annual and monthly payment plans with a 34% savings on their yearly plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

It also helps you and your employees manage tasks, generate reports, manage clients (with their built-in CRM), collaborate on content, and track time. Instead of spending time managing the project, focus your energy on the project itself. There are also integrations available on Teamwork. Use tools such as Slack, Drive, Hubspot, Dropbox, etc. alongside Teamwork.</p>

You can create an organization-wide group and then individual groups for each team. InsightTimer offers a complete dashboard so you can track overall employee trends within the app.</p>
